Comments for the Model are direclty inside of the Jupyter Notebook.

Graph_1:

This one was the most intuitive to me. If I have data from every country in the world, the first thing I will do is create a world map and insert the most recent data available for each country into the map to create a heatmap. I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. I used a color gradient that is less negative than the usual ones, where every country is just another shade of red. I think that makes the differences more easily discernable while not falsifying the acutal data.

For the rest of the graphs, I used the viridis scale for it's optimization of aesthetics, color blindness, and BW.

Graph_2:

I think that this one shows the differences between different regions in the world over time really well. It is a simple graph but that is part of it's charm. With only three lines, it is immediately understandable and strongly conveys the stark differences between the regions.

Graph_3:

This graph is a little unconventional. I thought that really made it interesting. I have never seen the gini coefficient in relation to the countries mean income before and I thought that the result is super interesting. I only used data from the 2000s onwards because I wanted to keep the graph relevant and not clutter it with data from 1940. I added a trendline so that the progression of the gini coeffcient with rising mean income is more easily understandable.

Graph_4: 

For this last graph, I wanted to make a barplot. I decided to display G20 member states, as those are usually of higher interest and gave them a reference point using the 5 countries with the highest and lowest gini coefficient.
